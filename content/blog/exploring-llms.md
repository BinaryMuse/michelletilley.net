Large Language Models have transformed how we think about AI and software development. Here are some thoughts on working with them.

## The Current Landscape

LLMs like Claude, GPT-4, and others have become incredibly capable at understanding and generating text, code, and more. They're being integrated into everything from IDEs to customer support systems.

## What I'm Excited About

A few areas I find particularly interesting:

1. **Code assistance** - Having an AI that understands your codebase and can help with refactoring, debugging, and writing tests
2. **Creative collaboration** - Using LLMs as brainstorming partners for design and architecture decisions
3. **Learning acceleration** - Getting explanations and examples tailored to your specific context

## Challenges Ahead

Of course, there are challenges to work through:

- Ensuring accuracy and avoiding hallucinations
- Managing context windows effectively
- Building appropriate trust and verification workflows

More thoughts on this to come in future posts.
