Welcome to my new blog! This is my first post, built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a fast static site generator written in Rust.

## Why Zola?

I chose Zola because:

- **Single binary** - No runtime dependencies, just download and run
- **Fast** - Builds are incredibly quick, even for large sites
- **Simple** - Straightforward configuration and templating
- **Built-in features** - Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, feeds, and more

## Getting Started

Creating a new post is as simple as adding a Markdown file to the `content/blog/` directory with some frontmatter:

```markdown

Looking forward to sharing more here soon!
